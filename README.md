# Fake News Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for a project that aims to identify and classify fake news articles from real news articles using text classification techniques. The project uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms to analyze and classify news statements based on their veracity.

## Dataset

The project uses the LIAR dataset, which consists of 12.8K human-labelled short statements obtained from PolitiFact.com. Each statement in the dataset is rated for truthfulness by an editor from PolitiFact.com. The dataset is available for download [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liar).

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are as follows:

1. To explore and implement different machine learning and deep learning text classification algorithms.
2. Evaluate the performance of these algorithms in identifying and classifying fake news articles.
3. Compare the performance of the implemented algorithms with an [existing fine-tuned model](https://huggingface.co/Jawaher/LIAR-fake-news-roberta-base) available from Hugging Face.
4. Establish a benchmarking framework to measure the performance of different models.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/iame-uni-bonn/final-project-irem-y`


## Results and Evaluation

The project aims to evaluate the performance of different text classification algorithms in identifying fake news articles. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results will be presented in the form of a comparative analysis between the implemented models and the pre-trained model from Hugging Face.

## Conclusion

By analyzing and comparing the performance of different text classification algorithms, this project aims to contribute to the field of fake news detection. The results can potentially contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable systems for identifying fake news and promoting information integrity.
